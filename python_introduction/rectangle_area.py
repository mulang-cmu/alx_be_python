Calculate the area of a rectangle using its length and width.
A Python script that calculates the area of a rectangle. The area of a rectangle is found by multiplying its length by its width.

    Instructions:

    1. Create a file named rectangle_area.py.
    2. Define two variables in this file:
        length with a value representing the length of the rectangle.
        width with a value representing the width of the rectangle.
    3. For simplicity, let’s use length = 10 and width = 5.
    4. Calculate the area of the rectangle using the formula (Area = length × width) and store the result in a variable named area.
    2. Print the calculated area in a format: The area of the rectangle is: [area].
"""
length = 10
width = 5

# Calcuating the area l X w
area = length * width

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(f"The area of the rectangle is: {area}")
