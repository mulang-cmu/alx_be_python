4. Personal Daily Reminder
mandatory
Objective: Create a simplified Python script that uses conditional statements, Match Case, and loops to remind the user about a single, priority task for the day based on time sensitivity.

Task Description:

Develop a script named daily_reminder.py. This script will ask the user for a single task, its priority level, and if it is time-sensitive. The program will then provide a customized reminder for that task, demonstrating control flow and loops without relying on data structures to store multiple tasks.

Instructions:

Prompt for a Single Task:

Ask the user to input a task description and save it into a task variable
Prompt for the task’s priority (high, medium, low) and save it into a priority variable
In a time_bound variable, Ask if the task is time-bound (yes or no)
Process the Task Based on Priority and Time Sensitivity:

Use a Match Case statement to react differently based on the task’s priority.
Within the Match Case or after, use an if statement to modify the reminder if the task is time-bound.
Provide a Customized Reminder:

Print a reminder about the task that includes its priority level and whether immediate action is required based on time sensitivity.
A message should be ‘that requires immediate attention today!’
"""

# prompt user to enter the task
task = input("Enter your task: ")

#select priority
priority = input("Priority (high/medium/low): ")

#Time BOund
time_bound = input("Is it time-bound? (yes/no): ")

match priority:
    case "high":
        if time_bound == "yes":
            print(f"Reminder: '{task}' is a high priority task that requires immediate attention today!")

    case "low":
        if time_bound == "no":
            print(f"Note: '{task}' is a low priority task. Consider completing it when you have free time.")
